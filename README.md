# CreativeP3

This project is aimed at translating Scheme code into C++ programs.

Most of our work is additional code in SyntacticalAnalyzer.cpp that will utilize our new class, CodeGenerator.
Check out the SyntacticalAnalyzer::Program() function to get an idea of how our CodeGen::WriteCode() calls will occur.

We currently need to do the following tasks:
- Finish commenting all files with our team name (Creative) and individual names
- Fill in all WriteCode() calls based on our rules/situations
