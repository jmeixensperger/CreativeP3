This project is aimed at translating Scheme code into C++ programs.

Most of our work is additional code in SyntacticalAnalyzer.cpp that will utilize our new class, CodeGenerator.
Check out the SyntacticalAnalyzer::Program() function to get an idea of how our CodeGenerator::WriteCode() calls will occur.
